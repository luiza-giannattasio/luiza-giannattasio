# Hi, thanks for coming! 

I'm Luiza, a professional in career transition and thrilled to be entering the world of data. 

I've discovered myself as a enthusyast data-driven person and been in this data world since 2023. I’m currently finishing my MBA in BI & Data Science. During this period, I worked in a few projects using Python and SQL, mostly. Now, I'm deepening all this SQL and Python knowlegde and studying at the Hashtag Treinamentos platform.
